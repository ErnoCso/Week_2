# Task 4

# Try extending the code below so that it creates a new variable called ‘average’,
# that is set to equal the average calculated from the two other variables.
# total = 98.2
# count = 5
#
# add your extra code here

total = 98.2
count = 5
average = (total+count)/2
print("The average of the total and count variables =", average)


# Output:

# The average of the total and count variables = 51.6
